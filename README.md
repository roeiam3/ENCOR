### `JSON-Test/`
**Goal:**  
Learning, Testing and Implementing Python & JSON Functionalities

**Key Highlights:**
- Authenticating to DNAC via Prior Projects
- Importing crucial modules
- Using json.dumps to turn JSON output into Python dict
- Using json.loads to turn Python dict into JSON output
- Parsing via Loops / manually the Python dict using the JSON Structure for reference
